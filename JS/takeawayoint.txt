    when to use map
        input and output (both array)
        and input and output length is same
        [1,2,3]=[2,3,6] (we can use map)
        [1,2,3]=[2,3,6,8] (we cannot use map) because output and input length doesnot match
        ["n","i","l","i"]=>["N","i","l","i"]can use map
        "nilima"=>["N","i","l","m","a"] can not use map
        ["N","i","l","m","a"]=>"nilima" can not use map

    when to use filter
        input and outpu must be array 
        is used to filter element 
        ouput elemnt are from the input elemnet
        [1,2,3]=>[1,2]  can use filter 
        [1,2,3]=>[4,1] can not use filter 
        "nitan"=>"nit" can not use filter
